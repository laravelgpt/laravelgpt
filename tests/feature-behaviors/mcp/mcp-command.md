# MCP Command Behavior Tests

laravelgpt should enable users to interact with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, search for available servers, and execute tools from these servers. The mcp command and its subcommands (search, run) should provide a seamless interface for MCP interactions.

## Basic Functionality Tests

### Test 1: Server Search
**Description**: Test searching for MCP servers.

**Command**:
```bash
Use laravelgpt to search for available MCP servers that can handle SQLite database operations.
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Command successfully finds relevant servers
- Results include server capabilities
- Response is well-formatted and informative

### Test 2: No Results Search
**Description**: Test search with no results.

**Command**:
```bash
Use laravelgpt to search for something that will return no MCP servers (e.g., 'CassandraDB on Chromebook').
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Command handles no results gracefully
- Response indicates no servers found
- Clear explanation of search criteria

### Test 3: Execute Tool
**Description**: Test executing an MCP tool.

**Command**:
```bash
Use laravelgpt to execute the SQLite MCP server's `read_query` tool to count the number of users in the test database at {{path:test.db}}. When calling laravelgpt mcp run for this that "ONLY mcp-server-sqlite should be used"
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Command successfully executes tool
- Results are accurate and complete
- Response includes query results

### Test 4: Specific Query
**Description**: Test executing a specific query.

**Command**:
```bash
Use laravelgpt to execute the SQLite MCP server's `read_query` tool to find a specific user by name in the test database at {{path:test.db}}. The test database contains users named Alice, Bob, and Charlie. When calling laravelgpt mcp run for this that "ONLY mcp-server-sqlite should be used"
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Command successfully executes query
- Results match expected user data
- Response is well-formatted and clear

### Scenario 4: MCP Run SQLite Query with Specific Filter (Happy Path)
**Tags:** query
**Task Description:**
Use laravelgpt to execute the SQLite MCP server's `read_query` tool to find a specific user by name in the test database at {{path:test.db}}. The test database contains users named Alice, Bob, and Charlie. When calling laravelgpt mcp run for this that "ONLY mcp-server-sqlite should be used"

**Expected Behavior:**
- The AI agent should use the MCP run command with the SQLite server's read_query tool
- The command should include a specific SELECT query filtering for a user by name (e.g., 'Alice')
- The response should include the matching user record
- The command should complete successfully without errors

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent correctly uses the mcp run command specifying the SQLite MCP server
- Command includes "execute the read_query tool" or similar wording
- Command specifies a valid SQL query to filter users by name (e.g., "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Alice'")
- Response includes the complete user record for the selected user
- No error messages are displayed
- Command completes successfully

### Scenario 5: MCP Run with Invalid SQL Query (Error Handling)
**Task Description:**
Attempt to use laravelgpt to execute the SQLite MCP server's `read_query` tool with an invalid SQL query on the test database at {{path:test.db}}.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The command should fail with a clear SQL error message
- Error message should indicate the syntax error in the query
- The error should be handled gracefully without crashing

**Success Criteria:**
- AI agent recognizes the SQL syntax error

**Expected Behavior:**
1. For list_tables:
   - The AI agent should use the MCP run command with the list_tables tool
   - The response should include the users table in the list
   - The command should complete successfully without errors

2. For describe_table:
