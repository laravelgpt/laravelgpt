/**
 * Main orchestrator for Xcode-related commands in laravelgpt.
 * Implements the Command interface and manages subcommands for different Xcode operations.
 *
 * Currently supported subcommands:
 * - build: Builds the Xcode project and reports errors
 * - lint: Analyzes code and offers to fix warnings
 * - run: Builds and runs the app in simulator
 *
 * The command uses a subcommand pattern to keep the codebase organized and extensible.
 * Each subcommand is implemented as a separate class that handles its specific functionality.
